# Terrain Generation with Perlin Noise

This Processing sketch demonstrates terrain generation using Perlin noise for natural looking landscapes.

If you want to run this application, I assume that you already have Processing either in its own IDE or included in your PATH variable. While Processing has its own IDE, you can also use other IDEs like VS Code, Atom, etc., as long as you have the path to the Processing bin folder included in your environmental variables.
